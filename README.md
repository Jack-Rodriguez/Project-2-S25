In-Memory File System (C++) â€“ Project Overview
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project involves designing and implementing a basic in-memory file system in C++, simulating Unix-like commands such as mkdir, cd, ls, pwd, cp, rm, and touch. The file system will be structured as a hierarchical tree, where each node represents either a file or a directory.

The goal is to provide core file system functionalities while reinforcing recursion, tree data structures, and dynamic memory management.

ðŸ“‚ Project Requirements
The program must support the following features:

Directory & File Creation

Users can create directories (mkdir) and files (touch) within the current working directory.
Navigation & Display

cd allows moving between directories.
pwd prints the absolute path of the current directory.
ls lists files and subdirectories in the current directory.
File & Directory Manipulation

rm removes files or directories, recursively deleting subdirectories if needed.
cp copies files or directories to a new location, handling deep copying for nested directories.
Recursive Operations

The system should support recursive directory copying and deletion while maintaining proper parent-child relationships.
Error Handling

The program should prevent invalid operations (e.g., trying to cd into a file, overwriting existing files in cp).
ðŸ”§ Implementation Details
The file system will be tree-based, where:
Each directory is a node that can have multiple children.
Each file is a leaf node with no children.
The system will always start with a root (/) directory.
Operations such as cp and rm will use recursion to handle nested directories.
The program will be memory-based and will not interact with the actual disk.
ðŸ›  Concepts Covered
Tree Data Structures â†’ Hierarchical file system representation.
Recursion â†’ Implementing rm and cp for deep deletion and copying.
Pointers & Memory Management â†’ Dynamically managing files and directories.
Object-Oriented Design â†’ Encapsulating file system logic in a class structure.
ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, the program will function as a mini Unix file system simulation, capable of creating, managing, and manipulating files and directories efficiently.
